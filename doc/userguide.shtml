 <p>MMS offers mobile
users enhanced messaging capabilities like the ability to send pictures and
sound from a cell phone. It is generally considered the natural successor to
the very popular SMS service.</p>

<p>MMS usage has
continued to grow since introduction, and it is expected that projects
such as Mbuni should further boost the adoption of MMS and its
explosion.  
</p>
<p>
The Mbuni Project attempts to provide that
little bit of boost to MMS adoption/growth, by providing two important parts of the
MMS infrastructure:  For the network &quot;operator&quot; Mbuni
includes a fully-fledged MMS switching centre (MMSC), while for the MMS
content provider Mbuni includes a MMS Value Added Services (VAS)
Gateway (MMSBox).</p>

<p>Mbuni implements all major MMS interfaces, including phone-to-phone (so-called MM1
interface), phone-to-email (MM3), inter-MMSC (MM4) and MMS VAS
(MM7). The level of support for each type of interface is listed on <a
								       href="status.shtml">status 
    page</a> of the website.
</p>

<p>Mbuni is
inspired, in part by the Kannel project, and utilises Kannel's GWLIB and WAP
libraries. Kannel provides
well-designed, simple interfaces for management of octet strings, lists,
threads, servers, etc, and a certified WAP implementation. This made
it a natural choice for Mbuni, rather than re-inventing the wheel.</p>

<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.1.1"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Overview of MMS</H4>
  
<p>The Multimedia
Messaging Service (MMS), is intended to provide a rich set of content to
subscribers (pictures, audio, games, etc). It supports both sending
and receiving of rich content by 
properly enabled client devices. MMS is a non-real-time delivery service, much
like SMS or email. The service utilises a store-and-forward usage model. </p>


<p> MMS is designed to be transported
largely over IP rather than traditional GSM (SS7) networks. It is also designed
to interoperate with other IP services such as email and WAP. In fact, MMS
messages are typically transported over WAP, and are encoded using WAP MIME
formats. </p>


<p> Multimedia messages can be originated by or terminate to end-user
  client devices (i.e. MMS-enabled phones) or third party applications
  (typically used by MMS content providers).  In the MMS architecture,
  the MMSC acts as the
message-switching system within the core network, while the MMSBox
  acts as the message dispatch and content management system on the
  VAS (third party) side. The overall architecture is
shown below.</p>

<center>
<img src="images/mmsgw.png" width="430" height="362">
</center>
<p >The elements
shown in the figure can be summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MMS
Client: </b>A device through
which the user receives or sends multimedia messages. This might be a phone or
a PC-based MMS client. The Client sends messages to and receives messages from
the MMSC using WAP/HTTP as transport.
<li><b>MMS
Gateway:</b> Switches
messages between different MMS clients and between MMS and Email. The Gateway
may also interface with other gateways to exchange messages destined for
foreign networks. This is also more properly known as the MMSC.
<li><b>MMS
Server:</b> This component
 provides persistent storage of messages on the network. Typically
users can access stored messages via a web interface.
<li><b>Other MMS
Systems:</b>Other systems,
such as Third Party MMS systems (e.g. MMS VAS providers) can interface to the
MMSC to receive and send MMS content. The Interface used is termed
MM7.
<li><b>SMSC: </b>The MMSC utilises WAP Push to send
notifications to MMS Clients. These are typically sent using SMS as the bearer
service, hence the need for a link to a Short Message Service Centre.
</ul>


<p>Typically, the
message cycle begins with a user sending a multimedia message (MM) from the MMS
client. The client must be configured for MMS, which includes bearer settings
(i.e. GPRS or GSM/CSD settings), WAP gateway address and MMS Gateway address (a
URL). On receipt of the message, the MMSC decides how to deliver the
  message (e.g. to another MMS client or to a VASP), and proceeds to
  dispatch the message. A VASP may also originate a message to the
  MMSC, for onward delivery.</p>


<p>An MM is typically a multi-part message
with pictures, sound, text and other media. Each part of the message is
identified by media (MIME) type, name and/or Content ID. Usually the
  message is of a multipart/related MIME type, with the start element
  being a <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SMIL</a> part that
  controls how the message should be displayed.
<br><br>
 When submitting a
message, the MMS client indicates the intended recipient list, but usually not
the sender address, which the MMSC retrieves from the WAP
gateway. Like Email, a single MMS can specify
multiple recipients (MSISDNs and Email addresses), and it is up to the MMSC
to ensure correct delivery to each of the recipients. </p>


<p>When the MMSC
receives a message destined for an email address, it typically re-codes the
message as standard MIME and passes it on to an SMTP server for delivery. Email
messages received are similarly re-coded as MMS and forwarded to the relevant
MMS Client.</p>

<p>When the MMSC receives a message
destined to MMS Clients in the area served by the MMSC, the message is
stored and an MMS notification sent to the recipient via WAP Push. On receipt
of the notification, the client typically fetches the message via a URL
provided in the notification.</p>



<p>When a recipient requests an incoming MM
from the server, it indicates to the server its capabilities for a User Agent
Profile URL. The profile data includes such things as supported media types,
screen size, supported character sets, etc. Typically, the MMSC will re-code
the MM to suit the client's capabilities before returning the message. Messages
destined to email may also be re-coded to make them more suitable for email
readers.</p>

<p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p>The MMSC may also interface with a
subscriber database, which controls message delivery and billing. The
subscriber database will provide such information as which subscribers are
provisioned for MMS, tariffs, etc.</p>

<p>
  On the VASP side of things, typically the content provider receives
  a request MM from a subscriber and must respond with an MM. The
  content to be sent back depends on the contents of the request.
</p>

<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.1.2"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Features</H4>


<p>Mbuni MMS gateway is a modular software system, designed to
be full-featured, efficient and simple, supporting current generation 
multimedia messaging. Mbuni operates in one of two modes: As an MMSC
  or as a VAS gateway. </p>

<ul>
<li> Operating as <b>MMSC</b>, Mbuni provides:
<ul>
<li>	Phone-to-phone messaging

<li>	Automatic content adaptation: The server modifies message
content depending on the capabilities of the receiving terminal 

<li>	Integrated Email-to-MMS and MMS-to-Email gateway

<li>	Support for persistent storage of messages for subscribers (MMbox).

<li>	Inter-MMSC message exchange (MM4 interface)
<li>    Support for MMS Value Added Service Providers using MM7
protocols (SOAP or EAIF).
<li>	Support for integration with subscriber database to enable
smart handling of handsets that do not support MMS, handsets not
provisioned, etc. 

<li>	Support for flexible billing structure through billing/CDR plug-in architecture

<li>	Bearer (data) technology neutral: Works with GSM/CSD or GPRS.

</ul>
<li>Operating as a <b>VAS Gateway</b>, Mbuni provides:

 <ul>
   <li> Support for both SOAP and EAIF connectivity with an operator
   MMSC (plus a special HTTP-based relay mechanism)
   <li> Multiple connections to different MMSC of different types can
   be maintained
  <li> MMS content can be loaded from file, URL or as the output of a
  program
  <li> MM composition from <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SMIL</a>: The gateway will automatically fetch
  all components referenced in the SMIL and add them to the MM.
  <li> A URL interface for MM dispatch.
 </ul>

</ul>

<p>

The Gateway is designed and tested to conform to Open Mobile Alliance
(OMA), WAP and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) MMS standards
including:  

<ul>
<li>	WAP: 209
<li>	OMA: MMS v1.2, UAProf v1.1
<li>	3GPP: TS 23.140
</ul>

</p>

<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.1.3"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Requirements</H4>

<p>
Mbuni is being developed on MacOS X and Linux systems using the C programming language.  It should compile and run on any similar system.
</p>

<p>
Mbuni utilises some libraries that are part of the Kannel source,
 specifically GWLIB and WAP libraries. In order to install Mbuni  you
 will need to install Kannel (and therefore fulfil those
 dependencies Mbuni shares with it).  
</p>
<a name="required"></a>
 The following additional components are required:
<ul>
<li>	Libiconv v2.0 or higher is required for character set conversions
<li>	Audio conversion tools required by the content adaptation module:
<ul><li>	Sox  from <a
href="http://sox.sourceforge.net">sox.sourceforge.net</a> 
<li>	Lame (v3.93 or higher) from <a
href="http://www.mp3dev.org">www.mp3dev.org</a> 
<li>	Mpg123 from <a href="http://www.mpg123.de">www.mpg123.de</a>
<li>	AMR encoder/decoder from <a
href="http://www.3gpp.org">www.3gpp.org</a> (modified, <a href="#install">see below</a>) 
</ul>
<li>	Image conversion tools required by the content adaptation
module:
<ul>
o	ImageMagick from <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">www.imagemagick.org</a>
</ul>
<li>	Mail server such as Postfix (<a href="http://www.postfix.org">www.postfix.org</a>)
<li>	You will also need to be running a WAP gateway (we recommend Kannel).
<li>	You may optionally need to run an HTTP proxy such as Squid
(<a href="http://squid-cache.org">squid-cache.org</a>), since some
newer phones (e.g. Nokia 6600) do 
not send MMS over WAP but directly over HTTP via an HTTP Proxy. 
</ul>

Hardware requirements will depend on amount of traffic, required
response times, etc. Keep in mind however that the gateway performs a
lot of heavy multimedia re-coding tasks, particularly during content
adaptation, so you should always err on the side of more rather than
less power. 

<a name="install"></a>
<H3><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.2"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Chapter 2: Installing The Gateway</H3>

<p>This section
explains the steps required to install the gateway. <strong>If you are
  installing from a binary distribution, you may safely skip to <a
								   href="#required_comps">here</a></strong>.
</p>

<p>
In brief, to install Mbuni, you need to:
<ul>
 <li>Download and install required packages (such as libXML, libiconv)
 <li>Download and install Kannel CVS (pre-1.4.2)
 <li>Download and install Mbuni 
 <li>Download, patch and install the AMR encoder/decoder
 <li>Download and install additional <a href="#required">requried</a> packages
</ul>
</p>

<p>The source code
for Mbuni is available for download from the <a
href="http://www.mbuni.org/downloads.shtml">download area</a>  of the website
</p>



<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.2.1"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Installing Kannel</H4>

<p>In order to compile the software, you
will first need to download  and install Kannel CVS (2008-07-07) from <a
href="http://www.kannel.org/download/kannel-snapshot.tar.gz">kannel.org</a>:</p>



<p>Unpack the kannel
source files using a command like:</p>

<p><tt>tar xvf 
kannel-snapshot.tar.gz</tt></p>



<p >Then proceed to
compile and install Kannel normally:</p>

<p>

<tt>cd kannel-snapshot; ./configure</tt>
<br>
<tt>make install</tt>
</p>

<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.2.2"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Installing Mbuni MMS Gateway</H4>


<p>Download and
unzip/tar Mbuni sources in a directory of your choice:</p>


<tt>tar xzf mbuni-<i>version</i>.tgz</tt>


<p>Where <i>version</i> is the verion of Mbuni (e.g. 1.2.0). Compile and
install mbuni as follows:</p>

<p ><tt>cd
mbuni-<i>version</i></tt><br>

<tt>./bootstrap</tt><br>
<tt> ./configure</tt><br>
<tt>make insall</tt>
</p>
You need to have AutoMake for the above to work
<p >If you installed
Kannel in a non-standard location, you will need to supply the location to <tt>configure</tt> using <tt>--with-kannel=<i>kannel_directory</i></tt></p>

<h5>Installing from CVS</h5>
<p> If you want to try out the development version of Mbuni, you can
 download it from the CVS on sourceforge.net:</p>

<tt>cvs  -d:pserver:anonymous@mbuni.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mbuni login</tt><br>

 followed by<br>

<tt> cvs -z3  -d:pserver:anonymous@mbuni.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mbuni co -P mbuni</tt><br>

 you can then 
 install as above.


<p >Mbuni consists of
3 programs:
<ul>
<li><tt>mmsc</tt>
<li><tt>mmsfromemail</tt>
<li><tt>mmsbox</tt>
</ul>
which are by
default installed in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>
</p>

<p ><tt>mmsc</tt> is the MMSC component. It consists of the relay
  server (<tt>mmsrelay</tt>), which routes
incoming messages to email, other MMS gateways, MMS clients/handsets,
  and the client-facing MMSC interface (<tt>mmsproxy</tt>) via which messages are 
sent and received by MMS clients (MM1 as well as MM7). <br><br><tt>mmsfromemail </tt>is
the email2MMS MMSC module. <br><br><tt>mmsbox</tt> is the VAS gateway

</p>


<a name="required_comps"></a>
<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.2.3"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Installing Required Components</H4>

<p>If you intend to use Mbuni as an MMSC, be sure to install all other required
components as detailed above, otherwise parts of the MMS gateway may not
function correctly. </p>



<p>Mbuni expects that an AMR decoder is installed and can be invoked
as: <br>
<tt>amrdecoder <i>infile outfile</i> </tt>
<br>

to decode an AMR
file to header-less (raw), 16-bit signed, mono, 8kHz audio samples in
the output file. (Input and output files may be '-' for standard input
or output respectively.)</p>

<p>Similarly, it is expected that an AMR encoder
called <tt>amrencoder</tt> exists and can be executed as follows: 
<br>
<tt>amrencoder <i>mode infile outfile</i></tt>
<br>and convert raw, 16-bit signed, 8kHz
 mono audio samples in the input file to AMR using the supplied
 encoding mode. 

<br>
<br>
For the AMR encoder/decoder, we have adapted the sample provided on the 3GPP
website. Follow the instructions below to install it:<br>

<ul>
<li>Download the AMR encoder/decoder source from <a
href="http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/26_series/26.104/26104-520.zip">here</a>

<li>unzip/unpack the zip file, and unpack the source within:<br>

<tt>unzip 26104-520.zip</tt><br>

<tt>mkdir amr</tt><br>

<tt>cd amr</tt><br>
<tt>unzip ../26104-520_ANSI_C_source_code.zip</tt><br>

<li>Download the AMR code patch from the mbuni.org <a href="downloads.shtml">download section</a> and apply as follows:<br>

<tt>patch -p1 &lt; ../mbuni-amr-patch</tt>
 <li> You should then compile and install the AMR encoder/decoder as follows:<br>

 <tt>make -f makefile.gcc</tt><br>
<tt>cp -f amrdecoder amrencoder /usr/local/bin</tt>
</ul>
This AMR encoder
is not very efficient but it works (which is important!)</p>

<H3><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.3"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Chapter 3: Running the Gateway</H3>
 
 How one runs Mbuni depends on its intended use or mode of
 operation. We look at the two usage scenarios below.
 
<h4><a name="run_mmsc"></a>Running Mbuni as a MMSC</h4>
<p>To run the MMSC, you must run  the command <tt>mmsc</tt>. <tt>mmsfromemail</tt>
should be called from your MTA (SMTP Mailer) to convert
and deliver an MMS from an email sender. The order in which they are started
is unimportant. </p>

<h4><a name="run_vas"></a>Running Mbuni as a VAS Gateway</h4>
<p> To run Mbuni as a VAS gateway you must run <tt>mmsbox</tt> </p>

<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A
NAME="Section_.1.3.1"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->General Configuration File</H4>

<p>All Mbuni programs expect the configuration file to be passed as the last
argument on the command line (default is <tt>mbuni.conf</tt>). The
configuration file controls most aspects of 
the operation of the gateway. </p>

<p >The configuration file format is the same as that used
by Kannel. The configuration file consists of groups of configuration
variables. Groups are separated by empty lines, each variable is defined on its
own line. Each group begins with the group name. Comments are lines that begin
with a hash (#) and are ignored.
<br><br>
A
variable definition line has the name of the variable, an equals sign (=) and
the value of the variable. The name of the variable can contain any characters
except white space and equals. The value of the variable is a string, with or
without quotation marks (&quot;) around it. Quotation marks are needed if the value
begins or ends with white space or contains special characters. Normal C escape
character syntax works inside quotation marks.</p>

<p >The variable <i>group</i> marks the
beginning of a new group with the given name.</p>

<b>Configuring Mbuni using a Loadable Module</b>
<p>Mbuni supports  configuration using a dynmically linked module.
  This is particularly useful if you wish to configure Mbuni from a
  database or a script. <br/><br/>
 In order to do this, the first (and only) group in the config file
  must be a <tt>config-source</tt> group. An example is shown below:
<br><br>

<tt>
group = config-source<br>
config-library = <i>path_to_dll</i><br>
config-library-init-param = <i>init_param_for_dynamic_lib</i><br>
</tt>
<br><br>
Mbuni will load the supplied DLL and get all subsequent configuration
parameters from the module. (See <tt>mms_cfg-imp.h</tt> for DLL requirements.)

<br><br>

</p>

<b>Configuration Items</b>
<p>
If not using a module as configuration source,
the <tt>config-source</tt> group must not exist. The rest of the
configuration file must have the format as described above. Groups
and respective items are described below.
</p>
<p >The core group is
<i>core</i> and defines the log file location, log level (amount of debugging
information &#8211; the lower the number the more debugging
information), the location of the access log, the HTTP interface to
listen on for incoming connections, HTTP proxy
host/port if any (HTTP proxy host/port and HTTP interface name 
 are specified using the exact same parameters as used by Kannel.) and
SSL client and server certificate files to be used for incoming and
outgoing HTTPS connections, if Kannel and Mbuni are compiled to have
SSL enabled. The syntax for specifying SSL certificates is exactly as
that used by Kannel. 

<br>
<br>
<tt>

group =
core<br>
log-file
= log/mmsgw.log<br>
log-level
= 0
<br>
access-log = log/access.log<br>
http-interface-name = &quot;*&quot;<br>
</tt>
</p>
<p>
This should be followed by the main gateway configuration group (<i>mbuni</i>). 
<br>
<br>
<tt>

group =
mbuni<br>

name =
&quot;My MMSC&quot;<br>

hostname
= ds.co.ug<br>

host-alias
= mmsc<br>

local-prefixes
= 075;+25675;25675<br>

directory-store
= spool<br>

max-send-threads
= 5<br>

send-mail-prog
= /usr/sbin/sendmail -f %f %t<br>

 ...<br>
</tt>
</p>
<p >The table below
lists all the configuration directives. The column <b>Mode</b>
  indicates operation mode in which the parameter is applicable:
  Config params marked <i>VAS GW</i>
   are only applicable when 
  operating in VAS Gateway mode, while those marked <i>MMSC</i>
  are only applicable  when
    operating in 
  MMSC mode. The rest are used in both modes.</p>

  keep this value short (as some handsets do not like long URLs in MMS

  as this can screw up URL location parsing. If you do not supply a
  host alias, the gateway will create a long form URL
  (http://<i>hostname:port/msgtoken</i>) when it sends notifications

<a name="builtin"></a><h4>Built-in billing, resolver and detokenizer
    modules</h4> 
Mbuni supports one type of built-in modules: Shell script
    handlers. Each expect a parameter that is a shell script that is
    used as follows:
<ul>
<li> If  <tt>billing-library</tt> configuration parameter is set
  to <tt>builtin:shell</tt>, the <tt>billing-module-parameters</tt>
  must the path to the shell script to be called by Mbuni to provide
  billing and CDR handling. For each message, the script will be with invoked
  each recipient as follows:
  <br><tt><i>script from_address to_address</i></tt>
<br>
 If the script returns with a non-zero exit status, the message is
 discarded.
<li> If <tt>resolver-library</tt> is set
  to <tt>builtin:shell</tt>, <tt>resolver-module-parameters</tt> must
  be set to a the path to the shell script to be invoked for each
  destination address to determine how to deliver the message. The
  script is invoked with one command line parameter (the destination
  address) and should output (on standard output) the hostname of the
  home MMSC (or MM7 connection ID in the case of <tt>mmsbox</tt>), to which the message should be routed.
<li>If <tt>detokenizer-library</tt> is set to <tt>builtin:shell</tt>
  then <tt>detokenizer-module-parameters</tt> should be set to the
  script that should be called to resolve the last part of the MM1
  request URL (the token) or
  sender IP address to sender number.  The shell is called with two
  arguments: The URL token and the IP address (in that order), and
  should output (on standard output) the sender number.

When an MM destined to an MSISDN cannot be delivered locally, the
gateway searches the list of Proxies to see if one of them can handle
the message. If one is found, the message is formatted as MM4 MIME
(according to 3GPP TS 23.140) and
sent via SMTP to the proxy.

 <b>Note: </b> Only one

 <tt>content</tt> should be speficied, as only one makes sense at any time. Specifying more than one causes others
 to be (silently) ignored. 
</p>

<p>

If a <tt>delivery-report-url</tt> or <tt>read-report-url</tt> is
specified for the send mms user (or as parameters in the send mms
request), and a report is sent to the VAS
Gateway by a MMSC, the relevant URL is called (using the HTTP GET
method), and information about the report sent to it via <a
							    href="#x_mbuni_headers"><tt><i>X-Mbuni</i></tt>
    headers</a>.
</p>

<p>
 The SendMMS interface can also be used to send binary content
 (e.g. binary-coded MMS, image or audio)
 directly to Mbuni. This is done as follows:
<ul>
<li>Send the binary content as the body of an HTTP POST request to the
  SendMMS port. Be sure to specify the correct body content type as part of
  the HTTP request headers. This is interpreted according to the rules
  set out <a href="#how_content">below</a>.
<li>Supply to the request URL all but the <tt>text</tt> and <tt>smil</tt>  URL
  parameters (as described above) as part of the request URL.
</ul> 
</p>
<a name="mms_service"></a>
<h5>MMS Service Configuration</h5>

<p>
 Messages are routed to services based on the first word of the text
 part of the MM. That is, Mbuni extracts the first text part of the
 MM, and finds the first word &mdash; the keyword &mdash; in the
 message. Mbuni then searches through the list of
 configured MMS Services for a matching service based on the
 keyword, and fetches the response from the  associated URL, file or
 program. 
</p>

<p>
 A sample service configuration might look like this:<br>

<tt>
group = mms-service<br>
name = me<br>
post-url = http://localhost/photoblog.php<br>
catch-all = true<br>
http-post-parameters = fx=true&amp;images[]=%i&amp;text[]=%t<br>
accept-x-mbuni-headers = true<br>
keyword = test<br>
</tt>

<b>How Response Content Is Interpreted</b>

<p>
  When the MMS Service response content is fetched for a service, or a message is
  pushed using the send-mms interface, it is converted into an MM based on the reported or
  inferred (in the case of <tt>file</tt> content) response content
  type. For content fetched from URLs, the content type is taken as
  received from the HTTP server. For <tt>file</tt> content it is
  inferred from the file extension. For <tt>exec</tt> content, it is
  assumed to be SMIL. 

 General conversion rules are as follows:<br>

 <ul>
  <li><b>SMIL:</b> If the content type is <tt>application/smil</tt>,
  the VAS gateway parses the SMIL and finds all content (e.g. images,
  audio) it references. (&quot;Referenced&quot; is
  currently interpreted as any element with an <tt>src</tt>
  attribute.) These are fetched and added to the
  response MM, and corresponding SMIL component modified
  (i.e. the <tt>src</tt> attribute modified) to reference
  the content within the MM. Note that the VAS gateway is smart enough
  to understand partial URL or file references
  (e.g. <tt>images/smile.gif</tt> or <tt>./test.txt</tt>), as well as
  absolute (e.g. <tt>/images/smile.gif</tt>
  or <tt>http://somehost/test.txt</tt>) references within the
  SMIL. It will attempt  to fetch the content relative to the
  location of the base SMIL content in the case of relative references. To prevent
  the content from being fetched, you can prepend a backslash to the
  location value. <br>
    The resulting MM will be a standard multipart/related message,
  with the SMIL as the start element.
  </li> 
<li><b>MMS Content Type:</b> If the returned content type
  is <tt>application/vnd.wap.mms-message</tt>, the content is assumed
  to be a binary-coded MM and will be returned as the response
  content. 
</li>
<li>
  <b>URL List type:</b> A special Mbuni mime
  type <tt>application/vnd.mbuni.url-list</tt> has been defined, and
  files with extension <tt>.urls</tt> are mapped to this content type
  (if the content type is not provided by the HTTP server or other
  means). Files of this type should contain a list of URLs
  (<tt>file://</tt> and <tt>http(s)://</tt> supported), one per
  line. Mbuni will load each content item from the URL and build an MMS
  containing the list of data items (<tt>multipart/mixed</tt>). 
  </li>

<li>
  <b>Other Content Types:</b> All other content types cause an MM to
  be built having the corresponding content type. Where the content
  type is not reported (or is impossible to determine) in the
  response, if the parameter <tt>assume-plain-text</tt> is set, MIME
  type <tt>text/plain</tt> is assumed.
  </li>
 </ul>

</p>

<br>
<a name="x_mbuni_headers"></a>
<b><i>X-Mbuni</i> Headers</b>
<br><br>
<p>
   Mbuni VAS Gateway utilises a number of HTTP extension headers to
   pass additional MM information to and receive information from the
   MMS Service. Note that all applicable headers are always sent in
   the HTTP request, but headers are only honoured in the response if
   the <tt>accept-x-mbuni-headers</tt> parameter of the service is set
   to <tt>true</tt>. On the response side, if honoured, the set values
   over-ride the ones in the request, and are used in the response.

 Note that the parameter name/value is repeated as many times in the

 there are three images in the MM and <tt>http-post-parameters</tt>
 is <i>image=%i</i> then the parameter <i>image</i> will be passed
 thrice, with different values. (The CGI script used must therefore
 be prepared to handle multiple parameters with the same name.) <br><br>

 Because <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> encoding is used in the HTTP
 POST transaction, the content type of each element, as well as its
 name (if present in the MM) are sent to the service URL.

<H3><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.4"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Chapter 4: Gateway Architecture</H3>

<p>
 In this section we provide an overview of the gateway architecture.

<br>

<a name="mmsc_arch"></a>
<h4>MMSC Architecture</h4>

As indicated, there are three components of the MMSC: The Relay
(<tt>mmsrelay</tt>), the Proxy
(<tt>mmsproxy</tt>) and SMTP/Email Interface (<tt>mmsfromemail</tt>). We describe the
function of each of these in turn. 
</p>

<H5><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.4.1"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->MMS Proxy</H5>

<p>

This component (<tt>mmsproxy</tt>) is the main point of interaction between the
gateway and MMS clients and VASPs. It provides an HTTP interface through which
clients can send MMS messages. From clients,  message types expected on this
interface are typically: 
<ul>
<li>	Send Request: Used by client to submit an MM to the
gateway. When received, the message is placed in the global queue. If
the client has requested that a copy by saved to the MMbox, this is done.
<li>	Forward Request: Used by the client to request the MM to
forward an MM. In this case the MM is resident on the gateway
(e.g. pending fetch by client) and is identified by its URL. The
message is retrieved and placed in the global queue for processing. If
a request to place a copy in the MMbox is indicated, this is done.
<li>	Notify Response: Is sent by client as a response to an MM
notification via Wap Push. This message indicates status information
such as whether the client wishes to defer fetching of the message,
etc. If the notification indicates that the message has been fetched,
the message is removed from the queue. If the notification indicates
that retrieval has been deferred, the message is marked so that no
further notifications are sent to the client about this message. 
<li>	Read receipt: If requested by the sender, a read receipt can
be forwarded via this interface. This is queued for delivery to the
recipient 
<li> MMbox Upload/Delete/Search: Upload and deletion to/from the user
MMbox are supported.
<li> MMbox search: A message search request when received is
processed. The proxy takes care to return only as much data as the
client can handle (as indicated by UA profile).
</ul>
All the above messages are sent to the proxy as the body of an HTTP POST request. 
Messages are retrieved by supplying the message URL in an HTTP GET
request. When such a request is received, the proxy:

<ol>

<li>	Locates the message: From the URL, the proxy can tell if this
is a message in the MMbox or in the in the queue for client-destined messages.
<li>	Extracts the User Agent Profile URL from the (HTTP) request
headers. If that is missing, the profile information is built out of
the HTTP Accept headers. The profile URL is passed to the content
adaptation module, which performs various modifications to the MM such
as: 
<ul>
<li>	Converting images in the MM to a format supported by the client
<li>	Scaling images to fit the screen size of the client
<li>	Converting audio in the MM to a format supported by the client
<li>	Converting text to a supported character set
<li>	Removing unsupported content from the MM
</ul>
note that profile data is cached 
(in <tt><i>storage-directory</i>/UserAgent_Profiles</tt>) so as not to have to fetch it each time. 
<li>	The message is then packed and returned to the client as the 
result of the HTTP request.

</ol>

<p>
Currently, no MMbox quotas are imposed. 
</p>


From VASPs mmsproxy expects and processes:
<ul>
<li>Send Requests: Used to submit messages for onward transmission by
Mbuni
<li> Cancellations: A previously submitted message can be cancelled if
it hasn't yet been routed to the next processor or receiver. (That is,
only messages still in the global queue can be cancelled.) Only the
original submitted can cancel a message.
<li>Replacement: A submitted message can be changed &mdash; the VASP may
				supply different content, which will
				then replace any content currently in
				th queue.
</ul>
<br>
Both SOAP and EAIF MM7 requests are supported.

<br>
This component must always be running.

</p>

<H5><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.4.2"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->MMS Relay</H5>

 The Relay manages routing of all messages (to phone, email, VASP). 
<p>
 The Relay watches the global queue for incoming messages (from VASP,
 external MMSCs or clients). For each message that arrives
in the queue, the relay: 
<ol>
<li>	Determines if the message is due for delivery attempt. An
attempt is made to deliver the message as soon as it is received
 (deffered delivery requests are honoured however), with
exponential back-off in case of failure. 
<li>	At the first delivery attempt, a call is made to the billing
module to effect billing and CDR generation. If the billing module
indicates that the sender does not have sufficient credit, the message
is discarded and the sender notified via delivery report. 
<li>	If the message is due for delivery attempt, the global sender
determines, for each recipient, how to deliver the message: 
<ol type="a">
<li>	If the message is destined for an email user, the message is
re-formatted as MIME, sender and recipient addresses normalised as RFC
822 addresses, and the message passed to the mailer. 
<li>If the the message is destined for a VASP (identified by short
code), then it is sent using MM7 protocols to the relevant VASP.
<li>	If the message is destined for a local MMS client, the message
is transferred to the mobile/local queue. A copy of the message is
sent (as MIME) to the MMBox host (if one is configured) 
<li>	If the message is destined for a foreign gateway, it is coded
as MIME and passed to the mailer for delivery via SMTP 
<li>	If the message cannot be delivered, the sender is notified.
</ol>
</ol> 
</p>

<p>

For messages placed in the mobile/local queue (i.e. those destined to
MSISDNs in the area served by this MMSC or IP-based clients), the
relay performs the following functions: 
<ol>
<li>	Notification is sent to the recipient client  via WAP Push
<li>	Delivery of other notifications such as delivery and read
reports to clients via WAP Push 
</ol>
SMS is used as the transport for WAP Push messages, if the recipient
is an MSISDN, otherwise UDP is used.
<br>
The Relay maintains a separate queue for messages pending delivery. At
set intervals (see configuration section), it sends notifications to
the recipient. It keeps sending notifications until the message is
fetched or the client indicates that it wishes to defer message
retrieval. A back-off mechanism is utilised to prevent flooding of
notifications. 
 A message will be removed from the queue if:
<ul>
<li>	It expires, either due to expiry period set within the message
being reached or system wide expiry time is reached. (The sender is
notified of expiry if they requested a delivery report) 
<li>	If the recipient retrieves the message
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<br>
A word about queue management: A simple queue management scheme is
used. Each queue entry consists of two files: The 'q' file (which is
plain text) contains the entry control data
(list of recipients, next delivery attempt time, etc), the 'd' file
contains the message data. This scheme is similar to that used by
popular MTAs.  Queue processors mostly operate on the 'q' file, and
use file locking to guard against duplicate delivery, file corruption,
etc. 
<br>
See <tt>mms_queue.h</tt> for details. 

</p>

<p>
<H5><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A NAME="Section_.1.4.4"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->SMTP/Mail Interface</H5>

The SMTP/Mail interface receives MMS from the MTA and routes them
depending on recipient or sending proxy. Specifically:
<ol>
<li>	If the
message is a send request, it is queued to the global queue for
delivery as long as the recipient is permitted via the interface (see
configs)
<li>	If the message is a notification (e.g. delivery
report), the interface carries out the necessary action
(e.g. forwarding of receipt or deletion of message from local
queue)
</ol>
<br>

This interface should be invoked from your MTA as follows:<br><br>
<tt>

mmsfromemail -f <i>from_address</i> -t <i>recipient_address</i> 
-s <i>sender_mmsc_hostname</i>  <i>[-x]</i> <i>[-n]</i> <i>conf_file</i>
</tt>
<br/>
<br>
The <i>-n</i> flag may be used to prevent stripping of the host/domain
part from the sender address. The <i>-x</i> flag causes the sender
address to be stripped of the <tt>TYPE=PLMN</tt> part.
<br>
Note that no IP-based security is provided at this
interface. It is expected that security measures (e.g. firewalls, etc) 
will have been setup to ensure that messages can only reach the MTA
and be handed over to this interface if they are legitimate.
</p>

<p>
<H5><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A
NAME="Section_.1.4.5"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Utilities</H5>

 We plan to add a number of utilities to the gateway.  The first of
 these is <tt>mmssend</tt>.
<br>
 <br>
<tt>mmsssend</tt> can be used to submit (inject) a message into the
 global queue. It should be invoked as follows:<br>
<br>
<tt>

mmssend -f <i>from_address</i> -t <i>recipient_list</i> -m
<i>mmsfile</i> [-b] <i>conf_file</i>
</tt>
<br><br>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>the recipient list can be a colon-separated list of multiple
recipients
<li>The MMS file may  be binary coded, or MIME. The utility tries to
guess which by inspecting the first byte of the file.
<li>From/To addresses are only used for delivery purposes (so internal
message headers may not be updated
<li>The <tt>-b</tt> flag, if specified, causes a copy of the message
to be saved in the sender's MMbox. (No check is made to confirm that
sender address is local!)
</ul>
The message is placed in he global queue with expiry set to the system
maximum, and the queue entry ID is printed to standard output.
</p>
<p>

<a name="vas_arch"></a>
<H4>VAS Gateway Architecture</H4>

<p>
 The VAS gateway consists of a single multi-threaded
 program <tt>mmsbox</tt>. This program performs a number of
 simultaneous functions, including receiving incoming MM from MMSCs,
 dispatching requests to services, composing and sending responses,
 and listening for and handling sendmms requests.  The key modules of
 the engine are described below.

</p>

<p>
 The VAS gateway maintains two main message queues: One for incoming
 messages (received from MMSCs), one for outgoing messages (received
 from services or the send-mms port). These are maintained in
 the <tt><i>storage-directory</i></tt> directory, in
 directories <tt>mmsbox_incoming</tt> and <tt>mmsbox_outgoing</tt>
 respectively. Queue structure is the same as that used by the MMSC component.

 <br> A separate directory (<tt>mmsbox_dlr</tt>) is maintained for storing DLR URLs.

</p>

<ul>
<li><b>SendMMS Module:</b> This module listens on
  the <tt>send-mms-port</tt> for incoming requests. These are
  received and turned into MM as described <a
  href="#how_content">above</a> and written to the outgoing
  queue. If the
  sender requested a read or delivery report (by specifying the
  requisite URL), the relevant URL is
  stored to the DLR URL store for future use. On success, the
  interface returns the message submission transaction ID (which is
  also reported with an DLR). </li>
<li><b>MMSC handler module:</b> Receives messages coming from MMSCs,
  and saves them to the incoming queue. Also watches the outgoing
  message queue for new messages, which it dispatches to the relevant
  MMSC based on recipient number routing (if the destination MMSC was
  not set)</li>
<li><b>Service Dispatch:</b> Reads messages from the incoming queue,
  determines which service to invoke, receives the result and creates
  a response MM, which is written to the outgoing queue. If the
  service requested a read or delivery report, the relevant URL is
  stored to the DLR URL store for future use.</li>
</ul>

<H3><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A
NAME="Section_.1.5"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Chapter 5: Tips & Tricks</H3>

 This section is a compilation of tips and tricks on making Mbuni work
 better for you 

<H4><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A
 NAME="Section_.1.5.1"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Passing
 MSISDNs to Mbuni MMSC</H4>
 As indicated earlier, Mbuni expects the MSISDN to be sent to it as a
 special HTTP request header. There are however times when it is
 either not possible, or not practical to insert the header into the
 MMS request. For such cases, Mbuni provides another way to specify
 the sender MSISDN: The last part of the URL passed in the HTTP
 transaction is passed to the De-tokenizer module (if specified),
 which should return a valid sender address. So for instance
 you can configure a clients to use a URL like <tt>http://mmsc/xYz12R2
 </tt>
 as the MMSC address, and Mbuni will pass <tt>xYz12R2</tt> to the
 de-tokenizer module, which must return the  sender
 address. Mbuni will only  do this it has failed to find the address request header.
<br>
 If no sender address (MSISDN) is found, Mbuni assumes that the MMS client is
 identified by IP address, and attempts to look up the IP address of
 the sender (see config section) and use that as the sender
 address. You can block this by specifying <tt>allow-ip-type = false</tt>
<br>
<br>
 Note that because of the above feature, you need to configure your
 WAP gateway and Mbuni IP security to ensure the system is not easily
 spoofed.
</p>

<h4>Sample Kannel WAP configuration<a name="Section_.1.5.2"></a></h4>
<p>
We provide a sample Kannel <tt>wapbox</tt> config below, with some explanation
<br>
<tt>
group = wapbox<br>
bearerbox-host = localhost<br>
log-file = "/tmp/wapbox.log"<br>
syslog-level = none<br>
access-log = "/tmp/wapaccess.log"<br>
timer-freq = 10<br>
map-url = "http://mmsc/* http://localhost:1981/*"<br>
</tt>
<br>
This is a live example that was used in tests. In the example we use:
<ul>
<li> <tt>wapbox</tt> URL mapping to convert incoming MMS request URLs
into the long form. Note that the MMS gateway always sends short form
URLs so you need something like this
<li>We increase the <tt>timer-freq</tt> (essentially
slowing the timer) because over
slow bearer (such as CSD), the WAP gateway tends timeout on large
messages. Not sure if it is wise to do this.  Although clearly whoever put this parameter in the config file expected it to be used!
</ul>

</p>

<H3><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:Begin--><A
NAME="Section_.1.6"></A><!--TableOfContentsAnchor:End-->Chapter 6: Log Files</H3>

The gateway writes a log file of important actions to the log file
configured. Message traffic is written to the access log in a standard
format.
